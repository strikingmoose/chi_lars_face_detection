    "# TFlearn & MNIST\n",
    "Okay, so before I jump right into classifying me and my girlfriend, I needed some way to get familiar with TFlearn first (or even Tensorflow for that matter). I watched sentdex's entire tutorial series on firing up Tensorflow and TFlearn and decided that TFlearn was a great way for me to ease into the whole world of NNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the MNIST data set that I had mentioned in my last post, sentdex writes an entire NN with 2 convolutional layers (RELU normalization), 2 max pooling layers, 1 fully connected layer, and 1 fully connected output layer which predicts the probability that an image is a specific number (remember, the MNIST data set consists of 55k classified hand-written digits to train on)... all in under 20 lines of code. Just ridiculous.\n",

    "\n",
    "## TFlearn and Tensorflow\n",
    "At its core, Tensorflow is a matrix manipulation library for python that just happens to lend itself well to NNs (I won't pretend like I've coded my own NNs from scratch before, but from what I read, NNs are generally combinations of computationally intensive matrix calculations). Tensorflow itself is written in C++ and CUDA (NVIDIA's language for programming GPUs), but has a python wrapper that allows us to take advantage of it using the python environment and syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "TFlearn, then, is an abstracted layer on top of Tensorflow which makes writing Tensorflow code _**even easier**_. I don't want to turn this into a entire post on Tensorflow vs TFlearn, but I do want to post the following two sentdex videos in which he runs through the same MNIST tutorial in both environments for reference:\n",

    "Ok, a few things to note here.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, I set the model to train for only 1 epoch because I wasn't sure how long it would take. Sure enough, the 1 epoch took about 300 to run... good for a speedy 5 mins and then some. In sentdex's tutorial, he trains on 10 epochs on a GPU system he built for himself. Again, I don't have a powerful system, nor does TF even support GPU processing on OSX (I have a MacBook), so training 10 epochs would've taken me roughly _**an hour**_. I mean, it's not like I haven't seen this before... I waited pretty long for some of my xgboost models to train. After some of those models, I legitimately felt like I was wasting time. Didn't want to go down the same path here, but the good news is that even after _**1 epoch**_, we're sitting at _**89.19% accuracy**_! That's kind of insane. From the papers I've read and videos I've watched, this is an extremely poor score relative to the best models out there in the world today for this use case, but isn't it kind of insane that _**I am literally able to copy and paste someone's code, use my shitty laptop to run 1 round of training, and come up with a black box that can recognize almost 89% of handwritten digits**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't even think I'm oversimplifying it, because that's literally what I just did. I realize that I'm leaving out a ton of details... what if the images have a background, what if the handwritten digit is smaller, what if it's a different color and not grayscale, what if the image has a lot of noise... we can ask a thousand questions challenging why something like this wouldn't work, and I 100% agree that those are the intricacies that make a good data scientist vs a world-class data scientist, but let's just step back and marvel at the fact that _**this thing can frickin recognize 89% of the hand-written digits in the test data set**_... That means that out of the 10k test images, this thing looked at _**8900**_ of the images and actually _**knew what number it was**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there are a few things that are blowing my mind here. I mean, let's set the context first that my mind is a naive, I don't have a PhD or even a masters degree, and I don't even quite understand every line of code in that NN yet.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://i.giphy.com/media/d2Z1HtgW9mFDnYac/giphy.webp\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",

    "However, just seeing that accuracy work right in front of my eyes makes this whole concept of image recognition a bit more tangible... You hear stories of all these crazy machine learning applications, but here is one working right in front of my eyes, with data I have on my machine, using the processing power of my shitty laptop. I think that's the first thing blowing my mind... just seeing it work live.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing is realizing how easily such a generic model learns the domain that it's working in. Nowhere in here did I hardcode that 0 is made up of a circle, or that a 2 looks like a backwards 5, or that a 4 is only composed of straight lines... In fact, I never even told the model that I was dealing with _**numbers**_ in any way! I just gave it some pixels values, a one-hot encoded label which doesn't mean anything to the computer anyways, and it figured out what the relationships were between those pixels and the array element that was flagged as a 1. We are simply referring to and perceive it as numbers when we look at the pixels in a 28x28 image, but a computer has no clue what we perceive! This is such a crazy generalization, because this is abstracting the model away from the application. The model is the magic that's performing the correlation detection between the input and the output, and the application can be anything at this point! Numbers, animals, cars... me and my girlfriend!\n",

I actually lied a bit in that I copied and pasted sentdex's code directly. sentdex is using the \"adam\" optimizer, but I don't really know what \"adam\" means yet, and my objective here is not quite to explore optimizers, so I just chose something that I knew... Stochastic gradient descent (sgd). Note that sentdex achieves something like 97/98% accuracy in his model, which I can only attribute to the changing of the optimizer (as well as the number of epochs). The loss function is \"categorical_crossentropy\", which seems like the one to use for multi-class classification (there also is a \"softmax_crossentropy\", but it seems to do the same thing as \"categorical_crossentropy\"... Not quite sure right now... Will explore this later if need be.\n",

Clearly not the case for me, and I really, really would like to not go down that rabbit hole because I'll probably be running a bunch of models, playing around with different parameters and I'll have to train like 10 CNNs of 10 epochs each... I don't have 10 hours to spare, unfortunately!\n",
